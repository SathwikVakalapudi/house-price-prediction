# House Price Prediction

A Machine Learning project to predict house prices using Python and common ML libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Untitled.ipynb`) that loads a housing dataset, performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 🧠 Project Overview

In this project, we build a regression model to estimate house prices based on multiple features such as:

- Number of rooms
- Square footage
- Location (encoded)
- Year built / age of house
- Other relevant property characteristics

The goal is to train an ML model that can generalize well on unseen data and provide accurate price predictions.

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Import Libraries**  
   Import all Python libraries and toolkits required for data manipulation and modeling.

2. **Load Dataset**  
   Load your housing dataset (CSV, JSON, etc.) into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. **Data Exploration**  
   Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations and descriptive statistics.

4. **Preprocessing**  
   Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numeric features.

5. **Model Training**  
   Train one or more regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

6. **Evaluation & Metrics**  
   Assess model performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² score.

7. **Prediction**  
   Use the trained model to predict house prices on new data.
